#### Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**  
   - Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
   - Option to reset passwords via email or OTP.

2. **Task Management**  
   - **Create Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with the following fields:
     - Title
     - Description (optional)
     - Due date
     - Priority (Low, Medium, High)
   - **Update Tasks**: Users can edit task details such as title, description, due date, and priority.
   - **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks permanently.

3. **Task Tracking**  
   - Users can mark tasks as:
     - Pending
     - In Progress
     - Completed
   - Tasks should have a status indicator based on their progress.

4. **Task Organization**  
   - Filter tasks by status, priority, and due date.
   - Sort tasks alphabetically or by due date.

5. **Notifications and Reminders**  
   - Notify users of upcoming due dates.
   - Allow users to set custom reminders for tasks.

6. **Progress Tracking**  
   - Display an overview of tasks:
     - Total tasks
     - Completed tasks
     - Tasks due today/this week
   - Visualize progress using charts or graphs.

7. **Offline Support**  
   - Allow users to access and manage tasks without an internet connection. Sync updates when reconnected.

8. **Multi-Device Sync**  
   - Enable task syncing across multiple devices for the same user account.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**  
   - App should load quickly and handle a large number of tasks efficiently.
   - Smooth transitions between screens.

2. **User Interface (UI)**  
   - Intuitive and user-friendly design.
   - Support for both light and dark modes.

3. **Platform Support**  
   - Compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

4. **Security**  
   - Encrypt user data.
   - Protect API endpoints against unauthorized access.

5. **Scalability**  
   - Support for increasing user base and task data without performance degradation.

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Frontend**  
   - Use React Native with Expo for cross-platform development.
   - Component-based architecture for scalability.

2. **Backend** (Optional for advanced features)  
   - RESTful API or GraphQL for data management.
   - Backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django) if using custom server logic.
   - Firebase for authentication, database, and notifications.

3. **Database**  
   - Use a local database (e.g., SQLite, AsyncStorage) for offline support.
   - Cloud-based database (e.g., Firebase Firestore) for real-time sync and multi-device support.

4. **State Management**  
   - Use Context API or Redux for managing application state.

5. **Testing**  
   - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and UI testing.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Publish the app on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
